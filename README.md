# Important preparation-info for the course:

It is important to prepare your laptop, computer, or remote server in order to be able to participate in the hands-on part of the course. Here a few comments about this:

- It is better if you have a Unix system on your computer (Linux, MacOS).  Windows is OK as long as you can run Python in it, however we won't be able to assist you in case of problems.
- Install the following packages, if possible with the indicated versions, but others are OK too:
<ul>
<li>pystan:                    3.10.0</li>
<li>arviz:                     0.19.0</li>
</ul>
