# Important preparation-info for the course:

It is important to prepare your laptop, computer, or remote server in order to be able to participate in the hands-on part of the course. Here a few comments about this:

- It is better if you have a Unix system on your computer (Linux, MacOS).  Windows is OK as long as you can run Python in it, and solve eventual problems with it.
- Install the following packages, if possible with the indicated versions (which for sure work correctly with Python 3.10.14 (you can use ``conda``) , but others are OK too:
  - pystan:                    3.10.0
  - arviz:                     0.19.0
